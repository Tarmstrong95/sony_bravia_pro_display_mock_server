# sony_bravia_pro_display_mock_server
A very crudely thrown together simple IP control enabled server that can be used to simulate interaction with a Sony Bravia display over TCP

You can find the link to the Sony Bravia simple IP control documentation below

# NOTE
This is just a quick crude reproduction of the server running on the Sony Bravia display. I haven't optimized anything or cleaned up anything. If you have an issue with how I did it, do it yourself.
